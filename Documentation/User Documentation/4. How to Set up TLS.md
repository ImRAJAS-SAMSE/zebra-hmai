## How to Set Up HTTPS for Zebra
  To set up TLS for Zebra Using your own CA certificate and key, follow these steps:
  1. **Edit server.cert and server.key**  
    In the cloned ```src``` folder of Zebra, a subfolder named ```sslcert``` contains the files needed to set up TLS for Zebra.  
    create two files in this directory(sslcert). these files are needed to set up SSl/TLS on ZEBRA  
    a. ***server.cert***
      * create a file named ```server.cert``` in this directory
      * copy the sample details below into the file
      * replace the comment with your certificate  
      ```
      -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
      //Please paste your certificate here
      -----END CERTIFICATE-----  
      ```
      b. ***server.key***
        * create a file named ```server.key``` in this directory
        * copy the sample details below into the file
        * replace the comment with your key  
      ```
      -----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----
      //Please paste your key here
      -----END PRIVATE KEY-----
      ``` 

  2. **Edit Zconfig**  
    After adding your private key and certificate to Zebra, You will need to edit 2 Zebra config parameters in the Zconfig.json file.  
      i. ***use_cert***  
          * This parameter needs to be set to ```true``` for zebra to use TLS.  
      ii. ***zebra_httptype***  
          * Finally, you will need to change this parameter's value to ```https```  
    **Note**: if you are running Zebra using management tool like npm (which does not check for file changes). You will need to restart zebra for changes to take effect.
