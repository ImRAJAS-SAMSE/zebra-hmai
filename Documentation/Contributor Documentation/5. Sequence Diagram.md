# Sequence Diagram
  1. ***RMF Monitor III Sequence Diagram***

    RMF monitor III Service is triggered when user send a request using /rmf3 Endpoint (e.g. localhost:3000/v1/{lpar}/rmf3/CPC).  
    V1Router receives the request and notify RMF3Controller. rmfIII() Function of the controller sends A HTTP API GET Request to DDS Server. This Returns an XML which is then sent to RMFMonitor3Parser. The parser then parse the XML into JSON and returns the JSON to the controllers rmfIII function. This JSON is finally sent to user through Express Response.

  2. ***RMF Post Processor Sequence Diagram***

    RMF pp service is also triggered when a user send a request using /rmfpp Endpoint (e.g. localhost:3000/v1/{lpar}/rmfpp/CPU).  
    V1Router receives the request and notify the controller. Rmfpp() function of the controller evaluates the value of report parameter(CPU or WLMGL). It then sends a HTTP GET request to DDS server. The returned XML is send to the appropriate parser(bodyParserforRmfWLMPP or bodyParserforRmfCPUPP) based on the value of the report URL parameter. The parser then parse the XML into JSON and returns the JSON to the controllers rmfpp function. This JSON is finally sent to user through Express Response.

  3. ***Static XML File***

    The static XML file service is triggered when a user sends a request using the apps /static Endpoint (e.g. localhost:3000/static?file=/home/salis).  
    staticXMLRouter receives the request and notify the controller. staticXMLtoJSON () function of the controller evaluates the value of type parameter(CPU or WLM). The controller re-use rmfppparser for parsing XML to JSON. The XML file specified in the URL file (takes file path) parameter is send to the appropriate parser (bodyParserforRmfWLMPP or bodyParserforRmfCPUPP) based on the value of the type URL parameter. The parser then parse the XML into JSON and returns the JSON to the controllers staticXMLtoJSON function. This JSON is finally sent to user through Express Response.

  4. ***MongoV1***

    Unlike the first three services, Mongov1 service does not require a trigger from user. The class contains a setInterval function that runs continuously based on the interval specified in the App configuration.  
    When setInterval function is activated, it send three request for CPC, PROC and USAGE JSON report by triggering the apps /rmf3 endpoint. For each report type (CPC, PROC And USAGE), v1Router sends a notification to RMF3Controller. rmfIII function of the controller sends a HTTP GET request to DDS for each report and the returned XML is sent to RMFMonitor3Parser. The parser parse each report and return 3 JSON to the rmfIII controller function. All 3 JSON’s are sent to Mongov1 class.  
    Using the fedDatabase() function of the Mongo class, The 3 JSON response are saved to the appropriate documents in MongoDB.  

  5. ***Prometheus Metrics***

    The Prometheus real-time class also does not need user intervention. It’s responsible for creating and saving Prometheus Custom metrics that can be used to plot real-time graphs using Grafana.  
    The setInterval function of the CPU real-time metrics class sends a request to the app /rmf3 for CPC JSON. The process of retrieving the JSON is similar to Mongo class. Data flow from router, controller and parser of the RMF Monitor III service. The JSON returned to CPU real-time metrics class is processed using a callback function. The JSON is filtered for Effective utilization, MSU and Total Utilization Values. These values are used to create custom gauge metrics using prom-client library. These metrics are saved into a register.
