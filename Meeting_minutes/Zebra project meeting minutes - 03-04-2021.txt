0) Vulnerability warning - Zowe currently checks vunerabiliy scan every month(going into 6 weeks). Salisu/Alex would upgrade the version of PUG

1) ZOWE Icon will be used for Zebra landing page for test site  - would avoid using incorrect modificiation of Zowe Logo.
   
2) New LSPR related API proposed - encouraged and very important to keep ISVs interested/involved on Zowe/Zebra.   Making a git repo branch to be discussed - there are pros/cons. Obvious naming would be required and keep cosistency between issue tracking/updates. API ML squad meeting would be a good place to get some advices. Bruce will reach around and ask feedbacks from z/OS community inside of IBM.

3) z/OS Native parser discussion: z Operational Insights(had SMF parser per Joe), SMF2SCV and similar program(Frank)  

4) Marist - more discussion will be needed how we can help 

5) ZOWE Survey results - about 80% had positive answer on the need for open source based RMF/SMF tooling

6) Containerizing Zebra? when it's good time, we can produce dockerized Zebra. Perhaps we can create a secure Docker container for Zebra and provide it to users/customers to deploy to IBM Cloud(Hyper Protect Virtual Server) to host RMF data in cloud securely.
