3) zebra_dev merged into main branch

4) Static API integrated to ZOWE API Catalog - let's discuss API ML authentication
  - need to set a separate session to discuss following proposed by Joe Winchester/Andrew Twydell
 * Have the Zebra API server take a JSON Web Token (JWT) from the API layer that will be passed as the bearer token on the REST PI request, and then have the API server call back to the API Mediation Layer to validate this.  https://dvlp.infinite-blue.com:7554/gateway/api/v1/auth/query  is the call to validate the token, passing the JWT as the bearer token .  Conceptuallly it's a handshake as API Gateway sends the token down to Zebra and Zebra calls back to API gateway checking it's valid.
 * We'll also need to update application.yaml to have the authentication: schema changed from byapass to zowejwt to have the token flowed down.
